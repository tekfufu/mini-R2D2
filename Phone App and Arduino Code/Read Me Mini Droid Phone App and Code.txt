Mini Droid App and Code info by Matt Zwarts

Refer to the instructions on the Mini Chopper files section for other details

The Phone app is the Choppy.apk file and is only for Android phones, 
install the .apk file into your phone files and run to install

The Mini_C1_10P_MZ_Rev_1.ino is the code to install into the arduino Nano

UPDATE: 28/3/2021

Lots of updates on both the code and app
- stability updates on the app and extra droids and functions added
- If the bluetooth isn't receiving then swap the code lines 32 and 33, block out is "//" this will flip it in the code
- code updated to include a new software serial, this was create a large delay in the signal read
- addition to the code to control the added front arms, periscope, 2-3-2 functions and sound/light reactions
- stability on the app for loss of bluetooth and general button issues
- old files archived

Install the Choppy_Rev2.apk on to your android device and then the code Mini_R2_Code_MZ_Rev_2 onto your arduino Nano
Run the software serial to ensure all signals are being received and should be good to go
