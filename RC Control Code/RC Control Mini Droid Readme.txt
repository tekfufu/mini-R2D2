Mini Droid RC Control Code

This code and electronics is intended to aid in using the RC signal from your receiver and then send out signal to the MX1508  motor drivers.

The code allows for control of 6 RC channel inputs, only 3 should be required for the mini droids motor control

The other functions on the mini droid, front arm movement and so on with servo control, can just have the servos plugged straight into the RC receiver

Hope it helps

Happy Building
